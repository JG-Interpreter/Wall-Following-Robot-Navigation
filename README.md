# Wall-Following-Robot-Navigation

This project explores supervised machine learning models on the Wall-Following Robot dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to classify the robot's movement direction (left, right, forward) based on 24 sensor inputs. We apply several classification techniques and analyze their performance, generalization ability, and robustness.
